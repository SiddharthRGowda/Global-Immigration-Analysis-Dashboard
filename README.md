## Overview

The **Global Immigration Analysis Dashboard** provides a historical view of migration trends spanning six decades. By showcasing migration flows across countries, the project helps users answer questions like:

- Which nations experienced the highest immigration?
- How have trends shifted over time?
- Are there discernible year-specific surges or declines?

## Key Features

- **Country Comparison**: Select two countries to compare historical immigration trends from 1960‚Äì2024  
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualize changes over time using line charts or area plots  
- **PDF / CDF Projections**: Understand diaspora distributions using probability density or cumulative distribution functions  
- **Top/Bottom Countries**: Aggregate average immigration to rank countries  
- **Custom Column Plots**: Flexible filtering to analyze any metric from the dataset  
- **Clean UI**: Responsive design built with Streamlit or intuitive layout in Power BI interface :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Data Source

- Based on **United Nations World Immigration Data** (1960‚Äì2024), preprocessed into a CSV or integrated into a Power BI data model :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Ensure the dataset starts with country-level headers and excludes metadata rows at the top
